                                I worked on the team to redesign the Moviefone app for all platforms. My task was to translate the iPhone designs to iPad in one of the later phases of the project, and help maintain the iPhone part of the project. My contributions to the project included asset cutting, wires, visual comps and visual QA. My goals were to take the existing iPhone design, which relied on a scrolling card layout, and adapt it to a larger format for iPads in a natural layout.

                                We initally mocked up several layouts for the client, and came to the final row and column structure. I took my coworker’s card structure and expanded it into rows for the iPad, with a sidebar containing all of the cards for the movie theater information. My thinking behind this was to feature the movie posters as the main element in the app, while still giving the user access to their favorite theaters and movies playing near them. The iPhone would lead from the card layout to a full-screen detail page, which I had decided would be overwhelming as a full-screen on iPad. I decided on modals to display the detail views, which organized the information in a much smaller and easier to read space. For the show and movie details, I decided to feature a full screen height movie poster with scrolling information to the right. This allowed the movie poster to be the featured item on the page, and serve as a constant visual cue to the user. It also made the information cards easier to read and scroll through. The fullscreen layout later inspired the fullscreen featured movie cards on iPhone as well.

                               I also worked to redesign certain elements of the iPhone app in the later phases. This included updating the app’s visuals per customer feedback, and designing the Filtering feature. I also worked closely with our development team to provide assets and visual QA on the app, to ensure that all added elements worked smoothly within the existing app. Throughout this process, I maintained up-to-date wireframes for the development and QA teams, and ensured the consistency of the app across multiple platforms and devices.
