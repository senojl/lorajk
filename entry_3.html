                                I was the sole designer for the UX/UI for this app. I worked with the Phunware platform to create an app that would have a way for people leaving the military to read articles about the transition process from military to civilian life, and created a custom module within the platform to allow the user to have a checklist for each of their milestones during the transition period. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One of the big challenges for this app was designing the milestones page. It was a process to find the best way to organize the information in a way that would make sense to the user, and be easy to view their finished goals. I included a color coded system that allowed the user to scan the side bar to view their finished goals, which are indicated in green. Some of the goals included subgoals, which would be nested in accordion menus for each goal. Checking off every subgoal would automatically check off the main goal.

                            <img class="article-image" src=" images/ups_1.png" border="0" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col">
                            <img class="article-image" src=" images/ups_2.png" border="0" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col mdl-card__supporting-text no-padding ">
                            <p>
                                It was also important to include a tagging system for the articles, so that the user could easily discern whether or not the articles would be relevant to them. This was done with both a filtering system and a color coded tagging system. The user could either manually scroll through the list and read each of the tags, or they could filter the articles by time or topic. This color coding system, along with the milestone system, followed the existing UPS design guidelines.
